            Hypertext Markup Language or <em>HTML</em> is a language that
            defines the structure of content on a webpage. Development started
            in 1989 at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee, who had just invented the
            world's first web browser, World Wide Web - the origin of WWW. But
            he needed a publishing language to display content within it, so he
            chose a syntax based on the Standard Generalized Markup Language,
            which uses opening and closing tags to provide meaning to otherwise
            unorganized text, like <b>H4</b> heading, <b>P</b> for paragraph,
            and, most importantly, <b>A</b> for anchor to link to a different
            webpage.
          </p>

          <p>
            The language underwent many changes during the initial rise of the
            internet and was standardized as HTML5 in <i>2008</i>, the version
            we know and love today. Modern HTML contains tags to handle a
            variety of different media types, like video, audio, and canvas to
            draw custom graphics on the fly.
          </p>

          <p>
            The typical HTML element starts with an opening and closing tag. In
            the middle, we have content, which might be text or additional HTML
            elements called children. The opening tag may also have one or more
            attributes, which are key-value pairs that can customize the
            appearance or behavior of the element.
          </p>

          <p>
            To build your first webpage, create a file named "index.html". This
            file contains a hierarchy of nodes based on the Document Object
            Model or DOM. A webpage starts with an HTML tag and has exactly two
            children: a head and a body. The head contains things that aren't
            directly shown in the webpage, like a title or a meta tag to give
            the page a description. But notice how the meta element has no
            closing tag. Closing tags are generally optional when an element is
            fully self-contained. The body contains the actual UI for the end
            user. We might start with an H1 heading, followed by a paragraph of
            content.
          </p>

          <p>
            To add an image, we use an <b>image</b> tag, which you'll notice is
            self-closing, then define the source attribute as the file path to
            the image, and you'll want to give it an alt description to make it
            accessible to robots and screen readers.
          </p>

          <p>
            What makes webpages revolutionary though is their ability to link to
            other webpages on the information superhighway. Use an anchor tag to
            create a link, then define the href attribute as the webpage that
            you want to navigate to when clicked.
          </p>

          <p>
            HTML also provides structural tags like division or div, which are
            often used to group elements together where they can be styled to
            represent complex UI elements like navbars.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you're happy with your code, grab the full file path to the
            HTML file and paste it into any web browser. Congratulations, you
            just built your first website!
          </p>
